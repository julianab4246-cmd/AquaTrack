# AquaTrack
AquaTrack is a management system that will help aquarium owners manage their tanks, fish, and conditions of their aquarium. 
| Week | Concept | Feature | Goal | Acceptance Criteria | Evidence in README.md | Test Plan |
|------|----------|----------|------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **10** | **Modeling** | Create `Fish`, `Tank`, and `Feeding` entities with relationships | App can represent which fish live in which tanks and record feeding events. | - [ ] `Fish` table created<br>- [ ] `Tank` table created<br>- [ ] `Feeding` table created<br>- [ ] Relationships configured (1-to-many, many-to-many if needed) | Implemented code; README write-up; ER diagram screenshot; migration screenshot | Run initial migration, inspect database schema; verify tables and relationships exist. |
| **11** | **Separation of Concerns / Dependency Injection** | Add `IAquariumService` to handle fish/tank management logic | Move business logic out of controllers to follow clean architecture. | - [ ] Service interface + implementation created<br>- [ ] Registered in DI container<br>- [ ] Controllers use constructor injection | Implemented code; README write-up explaining DI setup; screenshot of service registration | Hit endpoints to verify service methods are being used; check console/log output for expected behavior. |
| **12** | **CRUD** | Add Create/Edit/Delete pages for `Fish` entities | Allow users to manage fish records via web UI. | - [ ] Create/Edit/Delete views created<br>- [ ] Form validation works<br>- [ ] Database updates correctly | Implemented code; README write-up; screenshots of forms and success messages | Add new fish, edit details, delete fish, confirm DB updates via app and SQL query. |
| **13** | **Diagnostics** | Add `/healthz` endpoint and diagnostics middleware | Allow app to report health status (DB and app readiness). | - [ ] `/healthz` endpoint returns status<br>- [ ] Shows DB connection state<br>- [ ] Returns JSON response | Implemented code; README write-up; screenshot of `/healthz` JSON output | Access `/healthz` while DB is up and down; confirm response changes appropriately. |
| **14** | **Logging** | Log every feeding event with fish and time details | Record structured logs for each feeding to track aquarium care. | - [ ] Log message created on feeding<br>- [ ] Includes fish ID, tank ID, timestamp | Implemented code; README write-up; screenshot of logs in console/log file | Perform a feeding in the app; check that log entry is created with correct data. |
| **15** | **Stored Procedures** | Use stored procedure to list "Top 5 Oldest Fish" | Display leaderboard of oldest fish across tanks. | - [ ] Stored procedure created in DB<br>- [ ] App executes it via EF Core<br>- [ ] Results displayed on leaderboard page | Implemented code; README write-up; screenshot of SP results and page | Run SP in SQL Server Management Studio and compare to app output for consistency. |
| **16** | **Deployment** | Deploy AquaTrack to Azure App Service | Make app publicly accessible and verify production health. | - [ ] App Service created<br>- [ ] App builds & runs<br>- [ ] `/healthz` reachable<br>- [ ] CRUD path functional | Implemented code; README write-up; deployed URL; screenshots of live site | Visit public URL; confirm `/healthz` works; test one functional user flow. |
